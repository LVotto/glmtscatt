# GLMT-based electromagnetic field simulator
Luiz Felipe Machado Votto's graduation project on GLMT scattering. Supervised by Professor Leonardo André Ambrósio, Ph.D at EESC USP, Sâo Carlos-SP, Brazil. The project endeavors to evaluate the GLMT's effectiveness in representing already known waves and getting specific properties from them. This is a first step in developing a competent open-source tool for scientists.
